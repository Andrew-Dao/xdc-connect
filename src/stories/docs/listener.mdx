# Xdc Connect - `Functionality`

This documentation enlists the various event listeners & interface APIs exported from `xdc-connect`

## Listeners

XDC-CONNECT allows user to listen for state changes by providing the listeners as `props`.  
Currently you can listen for the following updates in your component :

1. On Wallet Connect - `onConnect`
2. On Wallet Disconnect - `onDisconnect`
3. On Address Change - `onAddressChange`

Each listener will be called with a parameter of `wallet` which represents the state of the connected xdc wallet post the event trigger.

### On Connect

Event is triggered when any of the loader successfully connects with application. The listener willl be called with an `wallet` object.

### On Disconnect

Event is triggered when any of the loader successfully disconnects with application. The listener willl be called with an `wallet` object.

### On Address Change

Event is triggered when any of the loader changes the default **XDC** address. The listener willl be called with an `wallet` object.

## APIs

1. **GetWallet** - returns promise which will resolve into `wallet` object.
2. **GetNativeBalance** - returns promise which will resolve into xdc balance.
3. **SendTransaction** - returns promise which will resolve into xdc3 `receipt` for the transaction.
